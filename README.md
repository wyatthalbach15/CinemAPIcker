### What is CinemAPIcker?
CinemAPIcker was designed to be a helpful tool for people that enjoy movies/tv and who may want to expand their portfolio.
With our clean design to make things simple, users will be able to do three things:
- Search for a movie/tv show/genre that they enjoy
- See where the relevant title/titles is/are currently streaming on the internet
- See related titles to the original search

Not only will these features allow users to discover where to watch titles they already love, but it will allow them to discover new titles to enjoy that are similar to the ones familiar to them.

In order to make our website as clean and functional as possible, we were able to utilize a few outside resources that make all the difference for the UX.
- Bulma, a CSS framework, allowed us to quickly develop a gorgeous style for our website that will help our users feel comfortable navigating around and using our site
- IMDBot, an API for pulling movie data, allows users to simply search for a title or genre and have information pulled up directly on the webpage. This info includes titles, movie posters, and descriptions
- WatchMode, an API for gathering streaming data, will return information on where a particular title is currently streaming right alongside the information from IMDBot

These three resources not only make our website functional, but easy and enjoyable to use for anyone who might be searching for a new title to watch.

The most exciting part about our site is that it is the first version of a site that can grow along with us. The next feature we hope to implement is a watchlist that will help users keep track of titles they find interesting but don't have the time to enjoy immediately. This and other exciting things are right aroudn the corner for CinemAPIcker!

### How to Use CinemAPIcker
Using our site is as easy as 1,2,3!
1. Navigate to the webpage at...
2. Type in a title/genre that you enjoy
3. Hit the search button
